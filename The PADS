/*  
a lot of givens. easy to make a mistake.
first query is easy, don't forget to order by name.
Second query has Count(Occupation) which is INTEGER(INT), we cast it to string (VARCHAR)
ALSO dont forget to make the occupation a lowercase (LOWER)
When you have COUNT, you need to group them by the thing you are counting. 
LASTLY, DONT forget to order them by COUNT AND Alphabetical order of Occupation, in case same number of occupations exist.

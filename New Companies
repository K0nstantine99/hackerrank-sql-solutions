/* we have many tables, but we only need to use, company table and employess table.
because of dublicates, make sure to count only DISTINCT.
NOW beucase of string company_code the order won't seem right. the system accepts it as the correct answer. BUT we can do better ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING)....
BUT the system won't accept it. so go back to original answer.

SELECT
            c.company_code,
            c.founder,
            COUNT(DISTINCT e.lead_manager_code),
            COUNT(DISTINCT e.senior_manager_code),
            COUNT(DISTINCT e.manager_code),
            COUNT(DISTINCT e.employee_code)
FROM        Company c
LEFT JOIN   Employee e ON e.company_code = c.company_code
GROUP BY    c.company_code, c.founder
ORDER BY    c.company_code ASC
                  ;

ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING(c.company_code, 2, LEN(c.company_code)) AS INT)

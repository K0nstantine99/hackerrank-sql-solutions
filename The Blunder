/*

1. First we REPLACE(Salary,'0','') zero with nothing.
2. Then we CAST it as DECIMAL(10,3)
3. Then we AVG that value. we will see her miscalculation.
4. Then we CAST(Salary AS DECIMAL(10,3)) and AVG that.
5. then we will have difference between two.
6. But the task wants us to round it to nearest integer.
7. We take it all and Round(,0) them. This does nothing. EVEN if it is correct answer.
8. We round it UP to nearest integer. WHICH WE DO BY USING CEILING(everything)
9. now we have the correct answer 2253

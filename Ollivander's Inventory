/*
  we have two tables. we do not join them. We create a temporary table to fix some things, then we join that one with the next.
in temptable, WE add ROW_numbers if something has same code and same power, they are ordered by cheapest option. we can also sort them by largest power, and code asc order.
then we add all the columns from Wands table. now every same code and power wand is ordered in row, cheapest coming first.

Now we select what we are asked to from the first table + age FROM Wands_Property table. We JOIN TEMPTABLE on code.
WHERE we choose non-evil wands. and the first and cheapest option as rownumber = 1
ORDERING BY power DESC and age DESC as we are asked in the task.

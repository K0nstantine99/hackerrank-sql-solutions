/* very confusing task, but the solution is basic and simple.
We start with the biggest table, then join them in order from bigger to smaller.
Starting with Submissions, then we join challenges, then we join Difficulty, but when we join difficulty WE also CONNECT Submission.Scores with Difficulty.Scores
LASTLY we join Hackers table.

IN SELECT we only need Hackers.id and Hackers.Name from Hackers Table.

Because all the tables are connected already, we GROUP the output BY hacker_id and Hackers.name

HAVING    COUNT(scores) >1 more than 1. because it is also a given.
We do not need to count scores in SELECT because they are already grouped in the tables we JOINED.

We ORDER BY the COUNT(s.scores) DESC, that is all we need to do.  */

            h.name
FROM        Submissions s
JOIN    Challenges c    ON  s.challenge_id = c.challenge_id
JOIN    Difficulty d    ON  c.difficulty_level = d.difficulty_level AND s.score = d.score
JOIN    Hackers h       ON  h.hacker_id = s.hacker_id
GROUP BY    h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING      COUNT(s.score) > 1
ORDER BY    COUNT(s.score) DESC, h.hacker_id

-- A lot of trial and error, but LEARNED that CASE checks one by one. if it doesnt work for the 1st check, then goes to next.
-- So have to type in checks in correct order. if it is not equilateral, then we check if it is isosceles and a triangle.
-- if it is neither, then we say it must be a SCALENE (no sides equal), WHILE also considering it indeed is a triangle (A+B>C)
-- if it passes none of these checks, then it is 'Not A Triangle' meaning we check (A+B>C) in previous line. no need to make another check here.
/*
2 sides equal means isosceles triangle
3 sides equal means equilateral triangle
no sides equal means scalene triangle
if two sides shorter than 1 side NOT a Triangle
*/

        WHEN    A + B > C THEN 'Scalene'

       -- A,B,C for manually(visually) checking if the code works, then we make it text after.

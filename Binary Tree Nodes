/* It is a little complicated to understand the question first.
we can SELECT ALL* first to see what is there.
AS I understand P is the parent node of N. WE have 3 cases to check
1. So if P value of N is NULL it means THEN it is a ROOT node. Then we can give the second CHECK
2. So if N exists in P (CASE WHEN N IN (SELECT P FROM BST) THEN it is an inner Node because it is a parent to some node)
3. If neither of the first two checks worked, it means the leftover NODES are not root, and are NOT Parent node to anyone else. ELSE "LEAF" END - meaning they must be leaf node.
We order by N because it is asked from us in the TASK. dont miss that.


SELECT
            N,
            CASE
            WHEN    P IS NULL THEN 'Root'
            WHEN    N IN (SELECT P FROM BST) THEN "Inner"
            ELSE "Leaf"
                END as BST_Type
FROM    BST
ORDER BY N
;
